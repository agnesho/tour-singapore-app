 ## Problem Statement
 > "How can we better adjust and adapt into New Norms in a Post-Covid world?"
 
 Your application may address new norms at a specific and/or generic level such as:

 - New Norms in Travel and Tourism
 - New Norms - General

## Solution
We developed a mobile application that allows Singaporeans to easily look up tourism spots in Singapore. Our team's goal is to boost our local tourism industry and provide residents with the experience of being tourists in their own country.

### Tech Stack
Front end: 
- React Native framework

[Back end](https://github.com/agnesho/aws-serverless-rest-api):
